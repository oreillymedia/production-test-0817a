<h1>Carly Szabo</h1>
<p>My name is Carly Szabo, and I love to read, write, and <b>edit</b> (emphasis on edit).</p>
<p>The day I figured out my true passion in life, I came home and told my father, "I want to be an editor." Prior to this epiphany, I had been studying to become an elementary school teacher at Rowan University. I learned quickly that I could not go on ignoring my true passion in life:  to write and to help others create beautiful, error-free copy with ease and finesse. Upon hearing my assertion that I was to pursue this dream of becoming an editor, my father said plainly, "Yes. Now <i>that</i> is something I can see you actually doing." </p>
<p>During my long journey through undergraduate school I held many positions in various publications ranging from Assistant Editor to Editor in Chief, honing my skills and waiting for the day I could make some serious contributions to the professional field of publishing. I received the 2015 Excellence in Writing Arts Award, an award granted to just one of the thousands of students within the College of Communications and Creative Arts. I graduated from Rowan University suma cum laude with a 3.87 GPA. But more than awards, grades, and high honors, I graduated from Rowan with a clear understanding of the field for which I worked so hard to become a part. I feel that I am ready to apply the skills I learned and become a true member of the publishing industry. With my experience and knowledge of writing, editing, and publishing, I assure you that I will exceed expectations within the role of Production Editor at <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Media</a>.</p>
